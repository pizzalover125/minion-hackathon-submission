# Robert the Minion
> Made by pizzalover125 and danieliscrazy/dld

Everybody loves minions... and so do we! We wanted to make a minion in real life, so that's exactly what we did! Meet Robert, an interactive minion powered by Orpheus Pico.

> This project was made for Undercity, a 4 day hardware hackathon at GitHub HQ!

Robert has two main parts. The internals, and the externals. Both are powered by an Orpheus Pico board. The internal Pico powers the eyes that blink and the waving arms. The external Pico powers the speaker, and the 6 buttons that control it.

We had to sacrifice a few features due to constraints, including a rotating body, a motion sensor, and a gyroscope, but we still feel happy with the results!
